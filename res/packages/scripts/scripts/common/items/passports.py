"""
Module provides common functionality for passport generation assuming that
generated passport satisfies some criteria.
Typical scenario of using module looks as follows:
* create generator using passport_generator for desired nation and premiality by suppliyng method
 that produces single passport:
 nationID = <some nation>

 pg = passport_generator(nationID, True, tankmen.passportProducer)
 passport = next(pg)

ATTENTION: Unconstrained generator such as above is infinite.
* To constrain generated passport, filters with signature (seqId, group, passport) -> bool, should be supplied.
Generation process can be constrained on number of attempts to generate, group the passport is generated from,
passport itself:

 pg = passport_generator(nationID, True, tankmen.passportProducer,
                        lambda seqId, group, passport: 'someTag' in group['tags'])
 passport = next(pg)

Make sure that criteria are feasible by providing the appropriate producer, of criteria that can be in principle
 satisfied. Otherwise next will loop forever.

* Criteria are combined via 'and' operation, all criteria are avaluated beforehand.
* Criteria can be soften by if any of filters raises StopIteration, generator then returns currently generated
passport that partially satisfies all criteria. After that generator is empty and should not be used.
* most frequent builders for filters are provide by module as well;
    - acceptOn(key, value) provides constraint that is satisfied when value is equal or contained in group[key];
    - distinctFrom(old) provides constraint that is satisfied when passport not in old;
    - uniformIds() provides constraint that is satisfied when passport has equal ids for last and first names;
    - maxAttempts(count) limits generation attempts to count, the last attempt will return any passport generated.
